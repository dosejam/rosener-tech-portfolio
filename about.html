            <h2>Hi, I'm David Rosener.</h2>
            <p>With over two decades of experience in enterprise IT, I built Rosener Tech Services to bring corporate-grade network solutions to the small and medium-sized businesses that drive our local community.</p>
            
            <p>My professional background is rooted in building and maintaining large-scale infrastructure. Previously, I served as a Network Administrator for Menards, and I currently work as a Network Engineer managing the infrastructure for a nationwide company with over 800 branch locations across the US. I know exactly what it takes to keep critical systems online, secure, and running flawlessly at scale—and I am passionate about scaling those exact same standards down to fit the budget and footprint of local businesses.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of the server room, my life is centered around faith and my family. I have proudly called the Wisconsin area home for the last 20 years. My wife and I have been married for over two decades, and we stay plenty busy raising our four kids, ranging in age from 6 to 18. Whether I am designing a secure VPN for a client, smoking a brisket on the weekend, or spending time with the family, I believe in doing things right the first time.</p>
            
            <p>I would love to connect and see how I can help streamline your IT.</p>
